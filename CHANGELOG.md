## [[v1.0.1](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1)] - 2018-06-23]

### Added

### Added

- security group id can be provided for either/both of the cluster and the workers. If not provided, security groups will be created with sufficient rules to allow cluster-worker communication. - kudos to @tanmng on the idea ‚≠ê
- outputs of security group ids and worker ASG arns added for working with these resources outside the module.

### Changed

- Worker build out refactored to allow multiple autoscaling groups each having differing specs. If none are given, a single ASG is created with a set of sane defaults - big thanks to @kppullin ü•®

## [[v0.2.0](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks/compare/v0.1.1...v0.2.0)] - 2018-06-08]

### Added

- ability to specify extra userdata code to execute following kubelet services start.
- EBS optimization used whenever possible for the given instance type.
- When `configure_kubectl_session` is set to true the current shell will be configured to talk to the kubernetes cluster using config files output from the module.

### Changed

- files rendered from dedicated templates to separate out raw code and config from `hcl`
- `workers_ami_id` is now made optional. If not specified, the module will source the latest AWS supported EKS AMI instead.

### Added

- Everything! Initial release of the module.
